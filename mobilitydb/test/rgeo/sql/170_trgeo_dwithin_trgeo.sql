-- Ever and always within a distance between two moving temporal rigid
-- geometries.
--
-- With both bodies moving continuously the answer follows from their exact
-- temporal distance: ever within a distance holds when the nearest approach is
-- within it, always within a distance holds when the farthest separation is.
-- A long rectangle rotates half a turn next to a body that stays put; the
-- nearest approach is about 0.94 and the farthest separation about 2.5.
