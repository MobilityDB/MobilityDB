/**
 * @brief A simple program that generates a given number of tfloat instants,
 * appends each generated instant into an output sequence, automatically
 * expanding the sequence if no more free space is available, and at the end
 * outputs the number of instants and the time-weighted average.
 *
 * This program and the program tfloat_expand.c in the same directory can be
 * used to compare the two alternative strategies for 
 * (1) assembling the sequence at the end from the input instants 
 * (2) expanding the sequence at each input instant 
 *
 * The instants are generated so they are not redundant, that is, all input
 * instants will appear in the final sequence. 
 *
 * The program can be build as follows
 * @code
 * gcc -Wall -g -I/usr/local/include -o tfloat_expand tfloat_expand.c -L/usr/local/lib -lmeos
 * @endcode
