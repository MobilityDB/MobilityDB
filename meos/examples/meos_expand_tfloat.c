/**
 * @brief A simple program that reads AIS data from a CSV file, constructs
 * trips from these records, and outputs for each trip the MMSI, the number of
 * instants, and the distance travelled.
 *
 * Please read the assumptions made about the input file `aisinput.csv` in the
 * file `02_meos_read_ais.c` in the same directory. Furthermore, this program
 * assumes the input file contains less than 50K observations for at most
 * five ships. Also, the program does not cope with erroneous inputs, such as
 * two or more observations for the same ship with equal timestamp values and
 * supposes that the observations are in increasing timestamp value.
 *
 * The program can be build as follows
 * @code
 * gcc -Wall -g -I/usr/local/include -o meos_expand_tfloat meos_expand_tfloat.c -L/usr/local/lib -lmeos
 * @endcode
