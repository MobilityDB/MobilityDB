/**
 * @brief A simple program that generates a given number of ttext instants,
 * appends the instant into a sequence at each generation, and outputs the
 * number of instants and the last value of the sequence at the end.
 *
 * The instants are generated so they are not redundant, that is, all input
 * instants will appear in the final sequence. A compiler option allows to
 * either use expandable structures or to create a new sequence at every new
 * instant generated.
 *
 * The program can be build as follows
 * @code
 * gcc -Wall -g -I/usr/local/include -o meos_assemble_tfloat meos_assemble_tfloat.c -L/usr/local/lib -lmeos
 * @endcode
