/**
 * @file tpoint_tempspatialrels.c
 * @brief Temporal spatial relationships for temporal points.
 *
 * These relationships are applied at each instant and result in a temporal
 * Boolean.
 *
 * The following relationships are supported for a temporal geometry point
 * and a geometry: `tcontains`, `tdisjoint`, `tintersects`, `ttouches`, and
 * `tdwithin`.
 *
 * The following relationships are supported for two temporal geometry points:
 * `tdwithin`.
 *
 * The following relationships are supported for two temporal geography points:
 * `tdisjoint`, `tintersects`, `tdwithin`.
 *
 * tintersects and tdisjoint for a temporal point and a geometry allow a fast
 * implementation by (1) using bounding box tests, and (2) splitting temporal
 * sequence points into an array of simple (that is, not self-intersecting)
 * fragments and the answer is computed for each fragment without any
 * additional call to PostGIS.
 *
 * The implementation of tcontains and ttouches involving a temporal point
 * and a geometry is derived from the above by computing the boundary of the
 * geometry and
 * (1) tcontains(geo, tpoint) = tintersects(geo, tpoint) &
 *     ~ tintersects(st_boundary(geo), tpoint)
 *     where & and ~ are the temporal boolean operators and and not
 * (2) ttouches(geo, tpoint) = tintersects(st_boundary(geo), tpoint)
 *
 * Notice also that twithin has a custom implementation as follows
 * - In the case of a temporal point and a geometry we (1) call PostGIS to
 *   compute a buffer of the geometry and the distance parameter d, and
 *   (2) compute the result from tpointseq_at_geometry(seq, geo_buffer)
 * - In the case of two temporal points we need to compute the instants
 *   at which two temporal sequences have a distance d between each other,
 *   which amounts to solve the equation distance(seg1(t), seg2(t)) = d.
