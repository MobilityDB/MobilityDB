/*
 *  Selectivity functions for temporal types operators.  These are bogus --
 *  unless we know the actual key distribution in the index, we can't make
 *  a good prediction of the selectivity of these operators.
 *
 *  Note: the values used here may look unreasonably small.  Perhaps they
 *  are.  For now, we want to make sure that the optimizer will make use
 *  of a geometric index if one is available, so the selectivity had better
 *  be fairly small.
 *
 *  In general, GiST needs to search multiple subtrees in order to guarantee
 *  that all occurrences of the same key have been found.  Because of this,
 *  the estimated cost for scanning the index ought to be higher than the
 *  output selectivity would indicate.  gistcostestimate(), over in selfuncs.c,
 *  ought to be adjusted accordingly --- but until we can generate somewhat
 *  realistic numbers here, it hardly matters...
